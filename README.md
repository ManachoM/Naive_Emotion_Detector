# Naive_Emotion_Detector
This repository contains a very simple and naive emotion detector using OpenCV modules and Paul Ekman's theory on microexpressions.
It comprises a good example of how OpenCV can be used in different applications, and it gives a good oportunity to compare different models on both face landmarks and face detection.
